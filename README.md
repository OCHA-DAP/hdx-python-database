The HDX Python Database Library provides utilities for connecting to databases in a standard way including
through an ssh tunnel if needed. It is built on top of SQLAlchemy and simplifies its setup.

For more information, please read the [documentation](https://hdx-python-database.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

This library is part of the [Humanitarian Data Exchange](https://data.humdata.org/) (HDX) project. If you have
humanitarian related data, please upload your datasets to HDX.
